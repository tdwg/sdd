# Structured Descriptive Data (SDD)

The goal of the SDD standard is to allow capture, transport, caching and archiving of descriptive data (data describing a taxon or specimen), using a platform- and application-independent, international standard. Such a standard is crucial to enabling lossless porting of data between existing and future software platforms including identification, data-mining and analysis tools, and federated databases.
