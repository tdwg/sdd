The copy of xlink placed here is borrowed from GML 3.
It is currently not yet used by UBIF/SDD, although we discussed
using href etc. from the xlink namespace instead from UBIF itself.

Major considerations for not using xlink were:
- lack of widespread acceptance of xlink
- some attributes (label, role) are unintuitively named.
- requirement to always add xlink:type="simple" as fixed attribute to all data (this will probably be lifted in a future xlink version!)
