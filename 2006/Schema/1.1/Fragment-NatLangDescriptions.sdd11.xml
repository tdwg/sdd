      <Detail role="Description">This version shows the same description with partial markup. Note that segmentation and parsing may be incomplete, which may be documented using the "parsed"-attribute. Note that the concept-, character- and state-ref values do not truly refer to appropriate definitions, they are given as examples only. The text should retain the full, unchanged original wording of the natural language description, the sequence of words should not be changed. The following example shows incomplete segmentation and parsing. The sdd standard is capable to store data with partial markup, resulting from any mixture of automatic markup by a processor or manual markup.  -->

        <!-- Correctly, the stipule-color character would not stop here. However, the machine process assumed in this example, may have to identify the boundaries of characters by identifying states. Currently only one of the two states has been recognized and the character markup is *incorrect* here. However, as soon as "yellow"  below is recognized at a later time, a process can recognize that two states of the same character occur directly after another, so that both states can be joined with one character. -->
