It documents only the root level annotations and components (elements, global attributes, simple and complex types, and groups). The definition of the components listed here is documented separately (hyperlinking could not yet be implemented).</p><p>Because the UBIF schema is designed as a type library, complex types represent class definitions and most schema files contain only a single root-level element.</p><p>Please see the <a href="rddl.html">schema documentation resource directory</a> for schema overviews of other files and detailed component documentation.</p><hr/><h2>Schema file content</h2><p>The following content is generated automatically from the documentation inside the schema file:</p><p>Top-level schema to be referenced in instance documents for validation; simplified alternative to SDD110.xsd!</p><p>This version contains only UBIF (SDD elements are supported, but not validated). To add further object types, this file has to be changed.</p><p>How this was created: SDD110.xsd copied, all SDD elements changed to VersionExtension type, all identity constraints removed.</p><p>Copyright © 2006 TDWG (Taxonomic Databases Working Group, www.tdwg.org). See the file SDD_(c).xsd for authorship and licensing information.</p><p><strong>Includes: </strong>UBIF_CoreExtensions.xsd</p><ul class="compact" compact="compact"><li><strong><a name="Datasets" id="Datasets">Datasets</a></strong> (<em>Element</em>): Root element for files or data streams. Multiple Dataset objects are completely independent. Potential relationship may be detected by the consumer, but are not expressed in the UBIF format. The sequence of Dataset objects has no semantics and does not have to be preserved.

The version of the UBIF standard used is defined in the namespace declaration and needs no separate data element.</li></ul><ul class="compact" compact="compact"><li><strong><a name="Dataset" id="Dataset">Dataset</a></strong> (<em>Complex type</em>, based on <em>OwnedAbstractObject</em> by extension): Dataset itself is derived from Abstract object, as are the base types for which it contains collections.

The first elements (Repres., Links, RevisionData, Owner, IPRStatem.) are content metadata for the entire data set / data collection. If, e.g. in response to queries, data subsets are extractet from a larger base data set, these metadata are not required to be specific to each document, but may may describe the base set itself. Link uri should then refer to the base set using rel=BasedUpon, and the dataset-uri may contain a query URI (or be omitted).

If a history of the data collection
(revised or expanded in various
projects or at different institutions, aggregated from multiple sources)
is available, this may be reflected in the IPR statements and possibly in
the list of Owners.

Note: if a data set is an extract from a larger base set, it is recommended to use 'Link rel = BasedOn' to point to the complete data set. Note that this may enable indexing robots to index the entire base data set.</li></ul><hr/><p>(Generated on 23. May 2006 by DiversitySchemaTools Version 0.5. Copyright (c) G.
