      <html:p>The Structured Descriptive Data (SDD) w3c-xml-schema defines a method to encode descriptive data in biology and other subjects. The primary goal of the design is to increase the knowledge and availability of knowledge about the diversity of life on earth. However, it may be used in many other areas (including medicine, pathology, archeology, anthropology) wherever objects or classes of objects are described for later reidentification. It is hoped that this standard will reach general acceptance to become a successor to existing standards like DELTA or NEXUS.</html:p>
      <html:p>The schema was designed by the Structure of Descriptive Data (SDD, http://www.diversitycampus.net/Projects/TDWG-SDD/index.html) group. SDD was established 1998 as a subgroup of the Taxonomic Databases Working Group (TDWG, www.tdwg.org) of the International Union of Biological Sciences (IUBS). Please refer to the SDD Charter (<html:a href="http://wiki.tdwg.org/twiki/bin/view/SDD/Charter">http://wiki.tdwg.org/twiki/bin/view/SDD/Charter</html:a>) for further information on purpose, scope, audiences, background, etc.</html:p>

        <html:strong>Technical schema conventions:</html:strong> blockDefault="#all" in xs:schema prevents substitution and that in instance documents derived types can be used in elements typed to the base type (which otherwise is possible using xsi:type=""). - finalDefault is not set, further type derivation is currently not considered problematic. Please contact us if you believe otherwise. Note that according to the w3c discussion forum, the developers of xml Schema consider to drop the final attribute in the upcoming XML Schema version 1.1. - The use of xsi:null is not supported in SDD documents (schema declaration nillable="false" is default, not explicitly stated).</html:p>
